====================

1. A method that returns the sum of two integers
```
START

# Given two integers, x and y 

SET sum = x + y 
PRINT sum 

END
```

2. A method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together
```
START

# Given an array of strings ary

SET mystring = JOIN ary

END 
```

3. A method that takes an array of integers, and returns a new array with every other element
```
START

# Given an array of integers ary

SET cnt = 0
SET new_ary

WHILE cnt < length of integers + 1
  IF cnt is odd
    add cnt element of array to new_ary
  cnt = cnt + 1

END   
```
