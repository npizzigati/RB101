Question 4
The Ruby Array class has several methods for removing items from the array. Two of them have very similar names. Let's see how they differ:

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
What do the following method calls do (assume we reset numbers to the original array between method calls)?

numbers.delete_at(1)
numbers.delete(1)

Answer:
delete_at removes the element at the index passed in while delete removes the element itself from the array
