Question 1
In this hash of people and their age,

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }
see if "Spot" is present.

Bonus: What are two other hash methods that would work just as well for this solution?

Answer:
Ages.include?('Spot')
Ages.key?('Spot')
Ages.any?(/Spot/)
Ages.member?('Spot')
