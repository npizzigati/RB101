# Practice Problem 6
# What is the return value of the following statement? Why?

# ['ant', 'bear', 'caterpillar'].pop.size

# Answer: The return value is 2, since size operates on the mutated array, not
# the return value of pop
# WRONG!
# #size operates on the return value of pop, which is caterpillar, so the
# answer is 11.
