    Rules of Twenty-One (Credit: Launch School)
    You start with a normal 52-card deck consisting of the 4 suits (hearts,
    diamonds, clubs, and spades), and 13 values (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
    jack, queen, king, ace).

    The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible, without
    going over. If you go over 21, it's a "bust" and you lose.

    Setup: the game consists of a "dealer" and a "player". Both participants are
    initially dealt 2 cards. The player can see their 2 cards, but can only see
    one of the dealer's cards.

    Card values: all of the card values are pretty straightforward, except for
    the ace. The numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value. The jack,
    queen, and king are each worth 10, and the ace can be worth 1 or 11. The
    ace's value is determined each time a new card is drawn from the deck. For
    example, if the hand contains a 2, an ace, and a 5, then the total value of
    the hand is 18. In this case, the ace is worth 11 because the sum of the
    hand (2 + 11 + 5) doesn't exceed 21. Now, say another card is drawn and it
    happens to be an ace. Your program will have to determine the value of both
    aces. If the sum of the hand (2 + 11 + 5 + 11) exceeds 21 then one of the
    aces must be worth 1, resulting in the hand's total value being 19. What
    happens if another card is drawn and it also happens to be an ace? It can
    get tricky if there are multiple aces in a hand, so your program must
    account for that.

    Card Value 2 - 10 face value jack, queen, king 10 ace 1 or 11 Player turn:
    the player goes first, and can decide to either "hit" or "stay". A hit means
    the player will ask for another card. Remember that if the total exceeds 21,
    then the player "busts" and loses. The decision to hit or stay will depend
    on what the player's cards are and what the player thinks the dealer has.
    For example, if the dealer is showing a "10" (the other card is hidden), and
    the player has a "2" and a "4", then the obvious choice is for the player to
    "hit". The player can continue to hit as many times as they want. The turn
    is over when the player either busts or stays. If the player busts, the game
    is over and the dealer won.

    Dealer turn: when the player stays, it's the dealer's turn. The dealer must
    follow a strict rule for determining whether to hit or stay: hit until the
    total is at least 17. If the dealer busts, then the player wins.

    Comparing cards: when both the player and the dealer stay, it's time to
    compare the total value of the cards and see who has the highest value.
