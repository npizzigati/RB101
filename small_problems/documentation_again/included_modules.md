Included Modules
================

Ruby version 2.4.0 introduced an Array#min method not available in prior versions of Ruby; we wrote this exercise before that release. To follow along, please use the documentation for Ruby 2.3.0 here.

Use irb to run the following code:

```
a = [5, 9, 3, 11]
puts a.min
```

Find the documentation for the #min method and change the above code to print the two smallest values in the Array.

Answer
------

puts a.min(2)
